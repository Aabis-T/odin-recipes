This will be a basic website that shows some recipes that I have not yet picked. Gotta be something delicious- nay, scrumptious, you know.

Well, it was chicken biryani, mushroom soup, and chocolate fudge. What a day. Am I right folks

After the project reflections:
I forgot how to insert an img from a lesson or 2 ago. Bummer. However, I now am sure that I will not forget it again! I def will lmao.
It's fine tho. practice makes perfect. Practice. Practice. Practice. Perfect.

One day, maybe.
